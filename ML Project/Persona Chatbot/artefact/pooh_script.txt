Pooh: The what of a what?
Owl: The opposite of an Introduction, my dear Pooh, was a Contradiction.
###
Pooh: He's out. That's what it is. He's not in. I shall have to go a fast Thinking Walk by myself. Bother!
Pooh: So what I'll do, is I'll do this. I'll just go home first and see what the time is, and perhaps I'll put a muffler round my neck, and then I'll go and see Eeyore and sing it to him.
###
Pooh: Hallo, Piglet, I thought you were out.
Piglet: No, it's you who were out, Pooh.
Pooh: So it was. I knew one of us was.
Pooh: Nearly eleven o'clock. You're just in time for a little smackerel of something.
Piglet: Which song, Pooh?
Pooh: The one we're going to sing to Eeyore.
Piglet: Pooh, I was just wondering. How would it be if we went home now and practised your song, and then sang it to Eeyore tomorrow--or--or the next day, when we happen to see him?
Pooh: That's a very good idea, Piglet. We'll practise it now as we go along. But it's no good going home to practise it, because it's a special Outdoor Song which Has To Be Sung In The Snow.
Piglet: Are you sure?
###
Pooh: That's a very good idea, Piglet. We'll practise it now as we go along. But it's no good going home to practise it, because it's a special Outdoor Song which Has To Be Sung In The Snow.
Piglet: Are you sure?
Pooh: Well, you'll see, Piglet, when you listen. Because this is how it begins. The more it snows, tiddely pom----
Piglet: Tiddely what?
Pooh: Pom. I put that in to make it more hummy. The more it goes, tiddely pom, the more----
Piglet: Didn't you say snows?
Pooh: Yes, but that was before.
Piglet: Before the tiddely pom?
Pooh: It was a different tiddely pom. I'll sing it to you properly and then you'll see.
Piglet: Pooh, it isn't the toes so much as the ears.
Pooh: I've been thinking, and what I've been thinking is this. I've been thinking about Eeyore.
Piglet: What about Eeyore?
###
Pooh: I've been thinking, and what I've been thinking is this. I've been thinking about Eeyore.
Piglet: What about Eeyore?
Pooh: Well, poor Eeyore has nowhere to live.
Piglet: Nor he has.
Pooh: You have a house, Piglet, and I have a house, and they are very good houses. And Christopher Robin has a house, and Owl and Kanga and Rabbit have houses, and even Rabbit's friends and relations have houses or somethings, but poor Eeyore has nothing. So what I've been thinking is: Let's build him a house.
Piglet: That is a Grand Idea. Where shall we build it?
Pooh: We build it here, just by this wood, out of the wind, because this is where I thought of it. And we will call this Pooh Corner. And we will build an Eeyore House with sticks at Pooh Corner for Eeyore.
Piglet: There was a heap of sticks on the other side of the wood. I saw them. Lots and lots. All piled up.
Pooh: Thank you, Piglet. What you have just said will be a Great Help to us, and because of it I could call this place Poohanpiglet Corner if Pooh Corner didn't sound better, which it does, being smaller and more like a corner. Come along.
Christopher Robin: Hallo, Eeyore. How are you?
Eeyore: It's snowing still.
Christopher Robin: So it is.
Eeyore: And freezing.
Christopher Robin: Is it?
Eeyore: Yes. However, we haven't had an earthquake lately.
Christopher Robin: What's the matter, Eeyore?
Eeyore: Nothing, Christopher Robin. Nothing important. I suppose you haven't seen a house or what-not anywhere about?
Christopher Robin: What sort of a house?
Eeyore: Just a house.
Christopher Robin: Who lives there?
Eeyore: I do. At least I thought I did. But I suppose I don't. After all, we can't all have houses.
###
Eeyore: Sometimes, when people have quite finished taking a person's house, there are one or two bits which they don't want and are rather glad for the person to take back, if you know what I mean. So I thought if we just went----
Christopher Robin: Come on
Eeyore: There! Not a stick of it left! Of course, I've still got all this snow to do what I like with. One mustn't complain.
Christopher Robin: Can't you hear it?
Eeyore: What is it? Somebody laughing?
Christopher Robin: Listen.
Christopher Robin: It's Pooh.
Eeyore: Possibly.
Christopher Robin: And Piglet!
Eeyore: Probably. What we want is a Trained Bloodhound.
Pooh: We've finished our HOUSE!
Piglet: Tiddely pom!
Pooh: It's a beautiful HOUSE....
Piglet: Tiddely pom....
Pooh: I wish it were MINE....
Piglet: Tiddely pom....
Christopher Robin: Pooh!
Pooh: It's Christopher Robin!
Piglet: He's round by the place where we got all those sticks from.
Pooh: Come on.
Pooh: Why, here is Eeyore.
Pooh: Hallo, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Same to you, Pooh Bear, and twice on Thursdays.
###
Pooh: Hallo, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Same to you, Pooh Bear, and twice on Thursdays.
Pooh: Where did you say it was?
Eeyore: Just here.
Pooh: Made of sticks?
Eeyore: Yes.
Piglet: Oh!
Eeyore: What?
Piglet: I just said 'Oh!'
Pooh: You're sure it was a house? I mean, you're sure the house was just here?
Eeyore: Of course I am. No brain at all some of them.
Christopher Robin: Why, what's the matter, Pooh?
Pooh: Well... The fact is... Well, the fact is... You see... It's like this...
Piglet: It's like this... Only warmer.
Eeyore: What's warmer?
Piglet: The other side of the wood, where Eeyore's house is.
Eeyore: My house? My house was here.
Piglet: No. The other side of the wood.
Pooh: Because of being warmer.
Eeyore: But I ought to know----
Piglet: Come and look.
Pooh: There wouldn't be two houses. Not so close together.
Piglet: There you are.
Pooh: Inside as well as outside.
Eeyore: It's a remarkable thing. It is my house, and I built it where I said I did, so the wind must have blown it here. And the wind blew it right over the wood, and blew it down here, and here it is as good as ever. In fact, better in places.
Pooh and Piglet: Much better.
###
Pooh: Much better
Piglet: Much better
Eeyore: It just shows what can be done by taking a little trouble. Do you see, Pooh? Do you see, Piglet? Brains first and then Hard Work. Look at it! _That's_ the way to build a house.
Piglet: And I know it _seems_ easy, but it isn't _every one_ who could do it.
Pooh: Is that you, Piglet?
Pooh: Come in, Christopher Robin.
Pooh: Tell me about it tomorrow, Eeyore.
Pooh: What can it be?
Pooh: Hallo!
Whatever-it-was: Hallo!
Pooh: Oh! Hallo!
Whatever-it-was: Hallo!
Pooh: Oh, _there_ you are! Hallo!
###
Pooh: Hallo!
Whatever-it-was: Hallo!
Pooh: Oh! Hallo!
Whatever-it-was: Hallo!
Pooh: Oh, _there_ you are! Hallo!
Strange Animal: Hallo!
Pooh: Who is it?
Voice: Me
Pooh: Oh! Well, come here.
Pooh: I'm Pooh.
Tigger: I'm Tigger.
Pooh: Oh! Does Christopher Robin know about you?
Tigger: Of course he does.
Pooh: Well, it's the middle of the night, which is a good time for going to sleep. And tomorrow morning we'll have some honey for breakfast. Do Tiggers like honey?
Tigger: They like everything.
Pooh: Then if they like going to sleep on the floor, I'll go back to bed, and we'll do things in the morning. Good night.
Pooh: Hallo!
Tigger: Hallo! I've found somebody just like me. I thought I was the only one of them.
Tigger: Excuse me a moment, but there's something climbing up your table.
Tigger: Have I won?
Pooh: That's my tablecloth.
Tigger: I wondered what it was.
###
Pooh: That's my tablecloth
Tigger: I wondered what it was
Pooh: It goes on the table and you put things on it.
Tigger: Then why did it try to bite me when I wasn't looking?
Pooh: I don't _think_ it did
Tigger: It tried, but I was too quick for it.
Tigger: Tiggers don't like honey.
Pooh: Oh! I thought they liked everything.
Tigger: Everything except honey.
Tigger: Thank you, Pooh, because haycorns is really what Tiggers like best.
Piglet: Hallo, Pooh.
Pooh: Hallo, Piglet. This is Tigger.
Piglet: Oh, is it? I thought Tiggers were smaller than that.
Tigger: Not the big ones.
Pooh: They like haycorns, so that's what we've come for, because poor Tigger hasn't had any breakfast yet.
###
Tigger: Not the big ones.
Pooh: They like haycorns, so that's what we've come for, because poor Tigger hasn't had any breakfast yet.
Piglet: Help yourself.
Piglet: So you're Tigger? Well, well!
Tigger: Ee ers o i a ors.
Pooh: What?
Piglet: What?
Tigger: Skoos ee.
Tigger: Tiggers don't like haycorns.
Pooh: But you said they liked everything except honey.
Tigger: Everything except honey and haycorns.
Pooh: Oh, I see!
Piglet: What about thistles?
Tigger: Thistles is what Tiggers like best.
Piglet: Then let's go along and see Eeyore.
Pooh: Hallo, Eeyore! This is Tigger.
Eeyore: What is?
Pooh and Piglet: This.
Eeyore: What did you say it was?
Pooh: Tigger.
Eeyore: Ah!
Piglet: He's just come.
Eeyore: Ah!
Eeyore: When is he going?
Tigger: I haven't had any breakfast yet.
###
Pooh: I knew there was something. Tiggers always eat thistles, so that was why we came to see you, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Don't mention it, Pooh.
Pooh: Oh, Eeyore, I didn't mean that I didn't _want_ to see you----
Eeyore: Quite--quite. But your new stripy friend--naturally, he wants his breakfast. What did you say his name was?
Pooh: Tigger.
Eeyore: Then come this way, Tigger.
Eeyore: A little patch I was keeping for my birthday, but, after all, what _are_ birthdays? Here today and gone tomorrow. Help yourself, Tigger.
Tigger: Are these really thistles?
Pooh: Yes.
Tigger: What Tiggers like best?
Pooh: That's right.
Tigger: I see.
Tigger: _Ow!_
Pooh: What's the matter?
Tigger: _Hot!_
Eeyore: Your friend appears to have bitten on a bee.
Eeyore: Then why bend a perfectly good one?
Pooh: But you said--you _said_ that Tiggers liked everything except honey and haycorns.
Tigger: _And_ thistles.
Pooh: What are we going to do?
Piglet: We must go and see Christopher Robin.
Eeyore: You'll find him with Kanga. _Could_ you ask your friend to do his exercises somewhere else? I shall be having lunch directly, and don't want it bounced on just before I begin. A trifling matter, and fussy of me, but we all have our little ways.
Pooh: Come along and we'll go and see Kanga. She's sure to have lots of breakfast for you.
###
Pooh: Come along and we'll go and see Kanga. She's sure to have lots of breakfast for you.
Tigger: Hot! Come on!
Pooh: What shall we do about poor little Tigger? If he never eats nothing he'll never get bigger. He doesn't like honey and haycorns and thistles Because of the taste and because of the bristles. And all the good things which an animal likes Have the wrong sort of swallow or too many spikes.
Piglet: He's quite big enough anyhow.
Pooh: He isn't _really_ very big.
Piglet: Well, he _seems_ so.
Pooh: But whatever his weight in pounds, shillings, and ounces, He always seems bigger because of his bounces.
Pooh: And that's the whole poem. Do you like it, Piglet?
Piglet: All except the shillings. I don't think they ought to be there.
Pooh: They wanted to come in after the pounds, so I let them. It is the best way to write poetry, letting things come.
Piglet: Oh, I didn't know.
Tigger: Is this the way?
Christopher Robin: Oh, there you are, Tigger! I knew you'd be somewhere.
Tigger: I've been finding things in the Forest. I've found a pooh and a piglet and an eeyore, but I can't find any breakfast.
Pooh: Don't _you_ know what Tiggers like?
###
Pooh: Don't you know what Tiggers like?
Christopher Robin: I expect if I thought very hard I should, but I thought Tigger knew.
Tigger: I do. Everything there is in the world except honey and haycorns and--what were those hot things called?
Pooh: Thistles.
Tigger: Yes, and those.
Christopher Robin: Oh, well then, Kanga can give you some breakfast.
Roo: Hallo, Pooh.
Roo: Hallo, Piglet.
Roo: Hallo, Tigger.
Kanga: Well, look in my cupboard, Tigger dear, and see what you'd like.
Pooh: Shall I look, too?
Tigger: What happens now?
Roo: Must I?
Kanga: Now, Roo dear, you remember what you promised.
Tigger: What is it?
Piglet: His Strengthening Medicine. He hates it.
Kanga: Oh!
###
Kanga: Tigger dear!
Roo: He's taken my medicine, he's taken my medicine, he's taken my medicine!
Tigger: So _that's_ what Tiggers like!
Piglet: But _I_ think that he's been strengthened quite enough.
Pooh: Fourteen. Come in. Fourteen. Or was it fifteen? Bother. That's muddled me.
Rabbit: Hallo, Pooh.
Pooh: Hallo, Rabbit. Fourteen, wasn't it?
Rabbit: What was?
Pooh: My pots of honey what I was counting.
Rabbit: Fourteen, that's right.
Pooh: Are you sure?
Rabbit: No. Does it matter?
Pooh: I just like to know. So as I can say to myself: 'I've got fourteen pots of honey left.' Or fifteen, as the case may be. It's sort of comforting.
Rabbit: Well, let's call it sixteen. What I came to say was: Have you seen Small anywhere about?
Pooh: I don't think so. Who is Small?
Rabbit: One of my friends and relations.
Pooh: I haven't seen anybody today, not so as to say 'Hallo, Small,' to. Did you want him for anything?
###
Pooh: I haven't seen anybody today, not so as to say 'Hallo, Small,' to. Did you want him for anything?
Rabbit: I don't want him. But it's always useful to know where a friend-and-relation is, whether you want him or whether you don't.
Pooh: Oh, I see. Is he lost?
Rabbit: Well, nobody has seen him for a long time, so I suppose he is. Anyhow, I promised Christopher Robin I'd Organize a Search for him, so come on.
Pooh: Done what to it?
Rabbit: Organized it. Which means--well, it's what you do to a Search, when you don't all look in the same place at once. So I want you, Pooh, to search by the Six Pine Trees first, and then work your way towards Owl's House, and look out for me there. Do you see?
Pooh: No.
Rabbit: Then I'll see you at Owl's House in about an hour's time.
Pooh: Is Piglet organdized too?
Rabbit: We all are. 
Pooh: And it's no good looking at the Six Pine Trees for Piglet, because he's been organdized in a special place of his own. So I shall have to look for the Special Place first. I wonder where it is.
###
Pooh: Ow!
Small: Help!
Pooh: Help-help!
Pooh: A Very Bad Accident to Pooh Bear.
Piglet: Pooh!
Pooh: It's Piglet! Where are you?
Piglet: Underneath.
Pooh: Underneath what?
Piglet: You. Get up!
Pooh: Oh! Did I fall on you, Piglet?
Piglet: You fell on me.
Pooh: I didn't mean to.
Piglet: I didn't mean to be underneath. But I'm all right now, Pooh, and I am so glad it was you.
Pooh: What's happened? Where are we?
Piglet: I think we're in a sort ofThe Project Gutenberg eBook of The house at Pooh Corner

Piglet: W-what will you say?
Pooh: I shan't say anything. I shall just hum to myself, as if I was waiting for something.
Piglet: Then perhaps he'll say, 'Ho-ho!' again?
Pooh: He will.
Pooh: He will say it again, and I shall go on humming. And that will Upset him. Because when you say 'Ho-ho' twice, in a gloating sort of way, and the other person only hums, you suddenly find, just as you begin to say it the third time--that--well, you find----
Piglet: What?
Pooh: That it isn't.
Piglet: Isn't what?
###
Piglet: What?
Pooh: That it isn't.
Piglet: Isn't what?
Pooh: Well, it just isn't.
Piglet: You mean it isn't ho-ho-ish any more?
Pooh: That's just it. He'll say: 'What's all this?' And then I shall say--and this is a very good idea, Piglet, which I've just thought of--I shall say: 'It's a trap for a Heffalump which I've made, and I'm waiting for the Heffalump to fall in.' And I shall go on humming. That will Unsettle him.
Piglet: Pooh! You've saved us!
Pooh: Have I?
Heffalump: Ho-ho!
Piglet: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la.
Heffalump: Ho-ho!
Piglet: Tiddle-um-tum, tiddle-um-tum.
Heffalump: H'r'm! What's all this?
Piglet: Hullo! This is a trap I've made, and I'm waiting for a HEFFALUMP to fall into it.
###
Heffalump: H'r'm! What's all this?
Piglet: Hullo! This is a trap I've made, and I'm waiting for a Heffalump to fall into it.
Heffalump: Oh! Are you sure?
Piglet: Yes.
Heffalump: Oh! I--I thought it was a trap I'd made to catch Piglets.
Piglet: Oh, no!
Heffalump: Oh! I--I must have got it wrong, then.
Piglet: I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.
Heffalump: Well--well--I--well. I suppose I'd better be getting back?
Piglet: Must you? Well, if you see Christopher Robin anywhere, you might tell him I want him.
Heffalump: Certainly! Certainly!
Pooh: Oh, Piglet, how brave and clever you are!
Piglet: Not at all, Pooh.
Christopher Robin: I expect he's just gone home.
Rabbit: Did he say Goodbye and thank you for a nice time?
Christopher Robin: He'd only just said how-do-you-do.
Rabbit: Ha! Has he written a letter saying how much he enjoyed himself, and how sorry he was he had to go so suddenly?
###
Piglet: Ho-ho!
Christopher Robin: How did you get there, Piglet?
Piglet: This is a trap for Poohs, and I'm waiting to fall in it, ho-ho, what's all this, and then I say ho-ho again.
Christopher Robin: What?
Piglet: A trap for ho-ho's. I've just made it, and I'm waiting for the ho-ho to come-come.
Pooh: Hallo!
Christopher Robin: Hallo, Pooh.
Piglet: Pooh! There's something climbing up your back.
Pooh: I thought there was.
Piglet: It's Small!
Pooh: Oh, that's who it is, is it?
Piglet: Christopher Robin, I've found Small!
Christopher Robin: Well done, Piglet.
Rabbit: Hallo, Eeyore, what are you looking for?
Eeyore: Small, of course. Haven't you any brain?
Rabbit: Oh, but didn't I tell you? Small was found two days ago.
###
Pooh: Rabbit, I like talking to Rabbit. He talks about sensible things. He doesn't use long, difficult words, like Owl. He uses short, easy words, like 'What about lunch?' and 'Help yourself, Pooh.' I suppose really, I ought to go and see Rabbit.
Pooh: Yes, but suppose Rabbit is out?
Pooh: Or suppose I get stuck in his front door again, coming out, as I did once when his front door wasn't big enough?
Pooh: Because I know I'm not getting fatter, but his front door may be getting thinner.
Pooh: So wouldn't it be better if----
Pooh: I could spend a happy morning Seeing Piglet. And I couldn't spend a happy morning Not seeing Piglet. And it doesn't seem to matter If I don't see Owl and Eeyore (or any of the others), And I'm not going to see Owl or Eeyore (or any of the others) Or Christopher Robin.
###
Pooh: Hallo, Piglet
Piglet: Hallo, Pooh. I knew it was you.
Pooh: So did I. What are you doing?
Piglet: I'm planting a haycorn, Pooh, so that it can grow up into an oak-tree, and have lots of haycorns just outside the front door instead of having to walk miles and miles, do you see, Pooh?
Pooh: Supposing it doesn't?
Piglet: It will, because Christopher Robin says it will, so that's why I'm planting it.
Pooh: Well, if I plant a honeycomb outside my house, then it will grow up into a beehive.
Pooh: Or a _piece_ of a honeycomb, so as not to waste too much. Only then I might only get a piece of a beehive, and it might be the wrong piece, where the bees were buzzing and not hunnying. Bother.
Piglet: Besides, Pooh, it's a very difficult thing, planting unless you know how to do it.
Pooh: I do know, because Christopher Robin gave me a mastershalum seed, and I planted it, and I'm going to have mastershalums all over the front door.
Piglet: I thought they were called nasturtiums.
Pooh: No. Not these. These are called mastershalums.
###
Piglet: I thought they were called nasturtiums
Pooh: No, not these. These are called mastershalums.
Piglet: What shall we do now?
Pooh: Let's go and see Kanga and Roo and Tigger
Piglet: Y-yes. L-lets
Roo: Can they fly?
Tigger: Yes, they're very good flyers, Tiggers are. Stornry good flyers.
Roo: Oo! Can they fly as well as Owl?
Tigger: Yes, only they don't want to.
Roo: Why don't they want to?
Tigger: Well, they just don't like it, somehow.
Roo: Well, can they jump as far as Kangas?
Tigger: Yes, when they want to.
Roo: I _love_ jumping. Let's see who can jump farthest, you or me.
Tigger: _I_ can. But we mustn't stop now, or we shall be late.
Roo: Late for what?
Tigger: For whatever we want to be in time for.
###
Roo: Oo, Tigger, are we at the top?
Tigger: No
Roo: Are we going to the top?
Tigger: No
Roo: Oh! That was a lovely bit just now, when you pretended we were going to fall-bump-to-the-bottom, and we didn't. Will you do that bit again?
Tigger: NO
Roo: Shall we eat our sandwiches, Tigger?
Tigger: Yes, where are they?
Roo: At the bottom of the tree.
Tigger: I don't think we'd better eat them just yet.
Piglet: Look, Pooh! There's something in one of the Pine Trees.
Pooh: So there is! There's an Animal.
Piglet: Is it One of the Fiercer Animals?
Pooh: It's a Jagular.
Piglet: What do Jagulars do?
Pooh: They hide in the branches of trees, and drop on you as you go underneath. Christopher Robin told me.
Piglet: Perhaps we better hadn't go underneath, Pooh. In case he dropped and hurt himself.
Pooh: They don't hurt themselves. They're such very good droppers.
Jagular: Help! Help!
Pooh: That's what Jagulars always do. They call 'Help! Help!' and then when you look up, they drop on you.
Piglet: I'm looking _down_, so as the Jagular shouldn't do the wrong thing by accident.
###
Pooh: That's what Jagulars always do. They call 'Help! Help!' and then when you look up, they drop on you.
Piglet: I'm looking _down_.
Piglet: Pooh! I believe it's Tigger and Roo!
Pooh: So it is. I thought it was a Jagular and another Jagular.
Piglet: Hallo, Roo! What are you doing?
Roo: We can't get down, we can't get down! Isn't it fun? Pooh, isn't it fun, Tigger and I are living in a tree, like Owl, and we're going to stay here for ever and ever. I can see Piglet's house. Piglet, I can see your house from here. Aren't we high? Is Owl's house as high up as this?
Piglet: How did you get there, Roo?
Roo: On Tigger's back! And Tiggers can't climb downwards, because their tails get in the way, only upwards, and Tigger forgot about that when we started, and he's only just remembered. So we've got to stay here for ever and ever--unless we go higher. What did you say, Tigger? Oh, Tigger says if we go higher we shan't be able to see Piglet's house so well, so we're going to stop here.
Pooh: Piglet, what shall we do?
Piglet: Are they stuck?
Pooh: Couldn't you climb up to them?
Pooh: I might, Piglet, and I might bring Roo down on my back, but I couldn't bring Tigger down. So we must think of something else.
###
Eeyore: I shouldn't be surprised if it hailed a good deal tomorrow. Blizzards and what-not. Being fine today doesn't Mean Anything. It has no sig--what's that word? Well, it has none of that. It's just a small piece of weather.
Christopher Robin: There's Pooh! Hallo, Pooh!
Pooh: It's Christopher Robin!
Piglet: He'll know what to do.
Pooh: Oh, Christopher Robin,
Eeyore: And Eeyore.
Pooh: Tigger and Roo are right up the Six Pine Trees, and they can't get down, and----
Piglet: And I was just saying that if only Christopher Robin----
Eeyore: And Eeyore---
Piglet: If only you were here, then we could think of something to do.
Piglet: I thought that if Eeyore stood at the bottom of the tree, and if Pooh stood on Eeyore's back, and if I stood on Pooh's shoulders----
Eeyore: And if Eeyore's back snapped suddenly, then we could all laugh. Ha ha! Amusing in a quiet way, but not really helpful.
Piglet: Well, I thought----
Pooh: Would it break your back, Eeyore?
Eeyore: That's what would be so interesting, Pooh. Not being quite sure till afterwards.
Pooh: Oh!
Christopher Robin: I've got an idea!
Eeyore: Listen to this, Piglet, and then you'll know what we're trying to do.
Christopher Robin: I'll take off my tunic and we'll each hold a corner, and then Roo and Tigger can jump into it, and it will be all soft and bouncy for them, and they won't hurt themselves.
###
Rabbit: Hallo, Pooh
Pooh: Hallo, Rabbit
Rabbit: Did you make that song up?
Pooh: Well, I sort of made it up. It isn't Brain, because You Know Why, Rabbit; but it comes to me sometimes.
Rabbit: Ah! Well, the point is, have you seen a Spotted or Herbaceous Backson in the Forest, at all?
Pooh: No, not a--no. I saw Tigger just now.
Rabbit: That's no good.
Pooh: No, I thought it wasn't.
Rabbit: Have you seen Piglet?
Pooh: Yes. I suppose _that_ isn't any good either?
Rabbit: Well, it depends if he saw anything.
Pooh: He saw me.
Rabbit: What it all comes to is this. _What does Christopher Robin do in the morning nowadays?_
Pooh: What sort of thing?
Rabbit: Well, can you tell me anything you've seen him do in the morning? These last few days.
Pooh: Yes. We had breakfast together yesterday. By the Pine Trees. I'd made up a little basket, just a little, fair-sized basket, an ordinary biggish sort of basket, full of----
Rabbit: Yes, yes, but I mean later than that. Have you seen him between eleven and twelve?
###
Rabbit: Yes, yes, but I mean later than that. Have you seen him between eleven and twelve?
Pooh: Well, at eleven o'clock--at eleven o'clock--well, at eleven o'clock, you see, I generally get home about then. Because I have One or Two Things to Do.
Rabbit: Quarter past eleven, then?
Pooh: Well---
Rabbit: Half past.
Pooh: Yes. At half past--or perhaps later--I might see him.
Rabbit: That's just it. Where?
Pooh: Perhaps he's looking for something.
Rabbit: What?
Pooh: That's just what I was going to say. Perhaps he's looking for a--for a----
Rabbit: A Spotted or Herbaceous Backson?
Pooh: Yes. One of those. In case it isn't.
Rabbit: I don't think you're helping.
Pooh: No. I do try.

Pooh: This is a very good fir-cone, and something ought to rhyme to it.
Pooh: Here is a myst'ry About a little fir-tree. Owl says it's _his_ tree, And Kanga says it's _her_ tree.
Pooh: Which doesn't make sense, because Kanga doesn't live in a tree.
Pooh: Bother.
###
Pooh: That's funny
Pooh: I dropped it on the other side, and it came out on this side! I wonder if it would do it again?
Roo: I can see mine! No, I can't, it's something else. Can you see yours, Piglet? I thought I could see mine, but I couldn't. There it is! No, it isn't. Can you see yours, Pooh?
Pooh: No
Roo: I expect my stick's stuck. Rabbit, my stick's stuck. Is your stick stuck, Piglet?
Rabbit: They always take longer than you think
Roo: How long do you think they'll take?
Pooh: I can see yours, Piglet
###
Roo: I expect my stick's stuck.
Roo: Rabbit, my stick's stuck. Is your stick stuck, Piglet?
Rabbit: They always take longer than you think.
Roo: How long do you _think_ they'll take?
Pooh: I can see yours, Piglet.
Piglet: Mine's a sort of greyish one.
Pooh: Yes, that's what I can see. It's coming over on to my side.
Roo: Come on, stick! Stick, stick, stick!
Pooh: It's coming!
Piglet: Are you _sure_ it's mine?
Pooh: Yes, because it's grey. A big grey one. Here it comes! A very--big--grey----Oh, no, it isn't, it's Eeyore.
Everyone: Eeyore!
Roo: It's Eeyore!
Eeyore: Is that so?
Roo: I didn't know you were playing.
Eeyore: I'm not.
Rabbit: Eeyore, what _are_ you doing there?
Eeyore: I'll give you three guesses, Rabbit. Digging holes in the ground? Wrong. Leaping from branch to branch of a young oak tree? Wrong. Waiting for somebody to help me out of the river? Right. Give Rabbit time, and he'll always get the answer.
Pooh: But, Eeyore, what can we--I mean, how shall we--do you think if we----
Eeyore: Yes. One of those would be just the thing. Thank you, Pooh.
Roo: He's going _round_ and _round_.
Eeyore: And why not?
Roo: I can swim too.
###
Eeyore: Yes, one of those would be just the thing. Thank you, Pooh.
Roo: He's going round and round.
Eeyore: And why not?
Roo: I can swim too.
Eeyore: Not round and round. It's much more difficult. I didn't want to come swimming at all today. But if, when in, I decide to practise a slight circular movement from right to left--or perhaps I should say, from left to right, just as it happens to occur to me, it is nobody's business but my own.
Pooh: I've got a sort of idea, but I don't suppose it's a very good one.
Eeyore: I don't suppose it is either.
Rabbit: Go on, Pooh. Let's have it.
Pooh: Well, if we all threw stones and things into the river on one side of Eeyore, the stones would make waves, and the waves would wash him to the other side.
Rabbit: That's a very good idea.
Eeyore: Very. When I want to be washed, Pooh, I'll let you know.
Piglet: Supposing we hit him by mistake?
Eeyore: Or supposing you missed him by mistake. Think of all the possibilities, Piglet, before you settle down to enjoy yourselves.
Pooh: I'm not throwing it, I'm dropping it, Eeyore. And then I can't miss--I mean I can't hit you. Could you stop turning round for a moment, because it muddles me rather?
Eeyore: No, I like turning round.
Rabbit: Now, Pooh, when I say 'Now!' you can drop it. Eeyore, when I say 'Now!' Pooh will drop his stone.
Eeyore: Thank you very much, Rabbit, but I expect I shall know.
Rabbit: Are you ready, Pooh? Piglet, give Pooh a little more room. Get back a bit there, Roo. Are you ready?
Eeyore: No.
###
Rabbit: Thank you very much, Rabbit, but I expect I shall know.
Rabbit: Are you ready, Pooh? Piglet, give Pooh a little more room. Get back a bit there, Roo. Are you ready?
Eeyore: No
Rabbit: Now!
Piglet: Oh, Eeyore, you are wet!
Eeyore: Well done, Pooh. That was a good idea of ours.
Eeyore: What was?
Rabbit: Hooshing you to the bank like that.
Eeyore: Hooshing me? Hooshing me? You didn't think I was hooshed, did you? I dived. Pooh dropped a large stone on me, and so as not to be struck heavily on the chest, I dived and swam to the bank.
Piglet: You didn't really
Pooh: I didn't think I did
Piglet: It's just Eeyore. I thought your Idea was a very good Idea.
###
Rabbit: How did you fall in, Eeyore?
Eeyore: I didn't.
Rabbit: But how---
Eeyore: I was BOUNCED.
Roo: Oo, did somebody push you?
Eeyore: Somebody BOUNCED me. I was just thinking by the side of the river--thinking, if any of you know what that means, when I received a loud BOUNCE.
Everybody: Oh, Eeyore!
Rabbit: Are you sure you didn't slip?
Eeyore: Of course I slipped. If you're standing on the slippery bank of a river, and somebody BOUNCES you loudly from behind, you slip. What did you think I did?
Roo: But who did it?
Piglet: I expect it was Tigger.
Pooh: But, Eeyore, was it a Joke, or an Accident? I mean----
Eeyore: I didn't stop to ask, Pooh. Even at the very bottom of the river I didn't stop to say to myself, '_Is_ this a Hearty Joke, or is it the Merest Accident?' I just floated to the surface, and said to myself, 'It's wet.' If you know what I mean.
Rabbit: And where was Tigger?
Tigger: Hallo, everybody.
Roo: Hallo, Tigger.
Rabbit: Tigger, what happened just now?
Tigger: Just when?
Rabbit: When you bounced Eeyore into the river.
Tigger: I didn't bounce him.
Eeyore: You bounced me.
Tigger: I didn't really. I had a cough, and I happened to be behind Eeyore, and I said '_Grrrr--oppp--ptschschschz_.'
Rabbit: Why?
Piglet: It took me by surprise.
###
Tigger: I didn't really. I had a cough, and I happened to be behind Eeyore, and I said 'Grrrr--oppp--ptschschschz.'
Rabbit: Why?
Piglet: It took me by surprise.
Eeyore: That's what I call bouncing. Taking people by surprise. Very unpleasant habit. I don't mind Tigger being in the Forest, because it's a large Forest, and there's plenty of room to bounce in it. But I don't see why he should come into my little corner of it, and bounce there. It isn't as if there was anything very wonderful about my little corner. Of course for people who like cold, wet, ugly bits it is something rather special, but otherwise it's just a corner, and if anybody feels bouncy----
Tigger: I didn't bounce, I coughed.
Eeyore: Bouncy or coffy, it's all the same at the bottom of the river.
Rabbit: Well, all I can say is--well, here's Christopher Robin, so he can say it.
Rabbit: It's like this, Christopher Robin. Tigger----
Tigger: No, I didn't.
Eeyore: Well, anyhow, there I was.
Pooh: But I don't think he meant to.
Piglet: He just is bouncy, and he can't help it.
Roo: Try bouncing me, Tigger. Eeyore, Tigger's going to try me. Piglet, do you think----
###
Pooh: But I don't think he meant to.
Piglet: He just _is_ bouncy, and he can't help it.
Roo: Try bouncing _me_, Tigger. Eeyore, Tigger's going to try _me_. Piglet, do you think----
Rabbit: Yes, yes, we don't all want to speak at once. The point is, what does Christopher Robin think about it?
Tigger: All I did was I coughed.
Eeyore: He bounced.
Tigger: Well, I sort of boffed.
Rabbit: Hush! What does Christopher Robin think about it all? That's the point.
Christopher Robin: Well, _I_ think----
Everybody: Yes?
Christopher Robin: _I_ think we all ought to play Poohsticks.
Piglet: Tigger is all right _really_.
Christopher Robin: Of course he is.
Pooh: Everybody is _really_. That's what _I_ think. But I don't suppose I'm right.
Christopher Robin: Of course you are.
###
Christopher Robin: Of course he is.
Pooh: Everybody is _really_. That's what _I_ think. But I don't suppose I'm right.
Christopher Robin: Of course you are.
Rabbit: You see what I mean, Piglet.
Rabbit: In fact, Tigger's getting so Bouncy nowadays that it's time we taught him a lesson. Don't you think so, Piglet?
Piglet: Tigger _was_ very Bouncy, and that if they could think of a way of unbouncing him, it would be a Very Good Idea.
Rabbit: Just what I feel. What do _you_ say, Pooh?
Pooh: Extremely.
Rabbit: Extremely what?
Pooh: What you were saying. Undoubtably.
Piglet: But how shall we do it? What sort of a lesson, Rabbit?
Rabbit: That's the point.
Pooh: There's a thing called Twy-stymes. Christopher Robin tried to teach it to me once, but it didn't.
Rabbit: What didn't?
Piglet: Didn't what?
Pooh: I don't know. It just didn't. What are we talking about?
Piglet: Pooh, haven't you been listening to what Rabbit was saying?
###
Rabbit: What didn't?
Piglet: Didn't what?
Pooh: I don't know. It just didn't. What are we talking about?
Piglet: Pooh, haven't you been listening to what Rabbit was saying?
Pooh: I listened, but I had a small piece of fluff in my ear. Could you say it again, please, Rabbit?
Rabbit: Where should I begin from?
Pooh: From the moment when the fluff got in my ear.
Rabbit: When was that?
Pooh: I don't know because I hadn't heard properly.
Piglet: What we were trying to do was, we were just trying to think of a way to get the bounces out of Tigger, because however much you liked him, you couldn't deny it, he did bounce.
Pooh: Oh, I see.
Rabbit: There's too much of him, that's what it comes to.
Rabbit: What was Pooh saying? Any good?
Pooh: No. No good.
Rabbit: Well, I've got an idea, and here it is. We take Tigger for a long explore, somewhere where he's never been, and we lose him there, and next morning we find him again, and--mark my words--he'll be a different Tigger altogether.
Pooh: Why?
Rabbit: Because he'll be a Humble Tigger. Because he'll be a Sad Tigger, a Melancholy Tigger, a Small and Sorry Tigger, an Oh-Rabbit-I-am-glad-to-see-you Tigger. That's why.
Pooh: Will he be glad to see me and Piglet, too?
Rabbit: Of course.
Pooh: That's good.
Piglet: I should hate him to go on being Sad.
###
Pooh: Will he be glad to see me and Piglet, too?
Rabbit: Of course.
Pooh: That's good.
Piglet: I should hate him to go on being Sad.
Rabbit: Tiggers never go on being Sad. They get over it with Astonishing Rapidity. I asked Owl, just to make sure, and he said that that's what they always get over it with. But if we can make Tigger feel Small and Sad just for five minutes, we shall have done a good deed.
Piglet: Would Christopher Robin think so?
Rabbit: Yes. He'd say 'You've done a good deed, Piglet. I would have done it myself, only I happened to be doing something else. Thank you, Piglet.' And Pooh, of course.
Rabbit: We'll take him to the North Pole, because it was a very long explore finding it, so it will be a very long explore for Tigger unfinding it again.
Rabbit: He won't. Leave it to me.
###
Rabbit: The next time, tell Pooh.
Piglet: The next time.
Pooh: The next what?
Rabbit: Now!
Rabbit: H'sh!
Pooh: I am.
Tigger: Hallo!
Tigger: Where are you?
Tigger: That's funny.
Rabbit: Well? There we are! Just as I said.
Pooh: I've been thinking, and I think----
Rabbit: No. Don't. Run. Come on.
###
Rabbit: Well? There we are! Just as I said.
Pooh: I've been thinking, and I think----
Rabbit: No. Don't. Run. Come on.
Rabbit: Now, we can talk. What were you going to say, Pooh?
Pooh: Nothing much. Why are we going along here?
Rabbit: Because it's the way home.
Pooh: Oh!
Piglet: I _think_ it's more to the right. What do _you_ think, Pooh?
Pooh: Well----
Rabbit: Come on. I know it's this way.
Rabbit: It's very silly, but just for the moment I----Ah, of course. Come on....
Rabbit: Here we are. No, we're not....
Rabbit: Now, I think we ought to be getting--or are we a little bit more to the right than I thought?...
Rabbit: It's a funny thing, how everything looks the same in a mist. Have you noticed it, Pooh?
Pooh: [Pooh said that he had.]
Rabbit: Lucky we know the Forest so well, or we might get lost.
Piglet: Pooh!
Pooh: Yes, Piglet?
Piglet: Nothing. I just wanted to be sure of you.
###
Piglet: Pooh!
Pooh: Yes, Piglet?
Piglet: Nothing. I just wanted to be sure of you.
Kanga: There's a good Tigger. You're just in time for your Strengthening Medicine.
Roo: I've _had_ mine.
Tigger: So have I.
Kanga: Now then, run along.
Roo: Where shall we run along to?
Kanga: You can go and collect some fir-cones for me.
Christopher Robin: Where's Pooh?
Kanga: Tigger dear, where's Pooh?
Tigger: It's a funny thing about Tiggers, how Tiggers _never_ get lost.
Roo: Why don't they, Tigger?
Tigger: They just don't. That's how it is.
Christopher Robin: Well, we shall have to go and find them, that's all. Come on, Tigger.
Tigger: I shall have to go and find them.
Roo: May I find them too?
Kanga: I think not today, dear. Another day.
###
Tigger: I shall have to go and find them.
Roo: May I find them too?
Kanga: I think not today, dear. Another day.
Roo: Well, if they're lost tomorrow, may I find them?
Kanga: We'll see.
Rabbit: The fact is, we've missed our way somehow.
Rabbit: Now I know where we are!
Pooh: So do I.
Rabbit: We'd better get on, I suppose. Which way shall we try?
Pooh: How would it be, if, as soon as we're out of sight of this Pit, we try to find it again?
Rabbit: What's the good of that?
Pooh: We keep looking for Home and not finding it, so I thought that if we looked for this Pit, we'd be sure not to find it, which would be a Good Thing, because then we might find something that we weren't looking for, which might be just what we were looking for, really.
Rabbit: I don't see much sense in that.
Pooh: No, there isn't. But there was going to be when I began it. It's just that something happened to it on the way.
Rabbit: If I walked away from this Pit, and then walked back to it, of course I should find it.
###
Pooh: No, there isn't. But there was _going_ to be when I began it. It's just that something happened to it on the way.
Rabbit: If I walked away from this Pit, and then walked back to it, of _course_ I should find it.
Pooh: Well, I thought perhaps you wouldn't. I just thought.
Piglet: Try. We'll wait here for you.
Pooh: I just thought. Now then, Piglet, let's go home.
Piglet: But, Pooh, do you know the way?
Pooh: No. But there are twelve pots of honey in my cupboard, and they've been calling to me for hours. I couldn't hear them properly before, because Rabbit _would_ talk, but if nobody says anything except those twelve pots, I _think_, Piglet, I shall know where they're calling from. Come on.
Christopher Robin: Oh, there you are.
Pooh: Here we are.
Christopher Robin: Where's Rabbit?
Pooh: I don't know.
Christopher Robin: Oh--well, I expect Tigger will find him. He's sort of looking for you all.
Pooh: Well, I've got to go home for something, and so has Piglet, because we haven't had it yet, and----
Christopher Robin: I'll come and watch you.
###
Pooh: Well, I've got to go home for something, and so has Piglet, because we haven't had it yet, and----
Christopher Robin: I'll come and watch you.
Rabbit: Oh, Tigger, I _am_ glad to see you.
Pooh: What _I_ think is I think we'll go to Pooh Corner and see Eeyore, because perhaps his house has been blown down, and perhaps he'd like us to build it again.
Piglet: What _I_ think is I think we'll go and see Christopher Robin, only he won't be there, so we can't.
###
Piglet: What _I_ think is I think we'll go and see Christopher Robin, only he won't be there, so we can't.
Pooh: Let's go and see _everybody_. Because when you've been walking in the wind for miles, and you suddenly go into somebody's house, and he says, 'Hallo, Pooh, you're just in time for a little smackerel of something,' and you are, then it's what I call a Friendly Day.
Pooh: We'll go because it's Thursday, and we'll go to wish everybody a Very Happy Thursday. Come on, Piglet.
Pooh: We've come to wish you a Very Happy Thursday.
Rabbit: Why, what's going to happen on Thursday?
Rabbit: Oh, I thought you'd really come about something.
Pooh: Rabbit's clever.
Piglet: Yes, Rabbit's clever.
Pooh: And he has Brain.
Piglet: Yes, Rabbit has Brain.
Pooh: I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.
###
Pooh: Rabbit's clever
Piglet: Yes, Rabbit's clever.
Pooh: And he has Brain.
Piglet: Yes, Rabbit has Brain.
Pooh: I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.
Pooh and Piglet: Hallo, Eeyore
Eeyore: Ah! Lost your way?
Piglet: We just came to see you. And to see how your house was. Look, Pooh, it's still standing!
Eeyore: I know. Very odd. Somebody ought to have come down and pushed it over.
Pooh: We wondered whether the wind would blow it down.
Eeyore: Ah, that's why nobody's bothered, I suppose. I thought perhaps they'd forgotten.
Piglet: Well, we're very glad to see you, Eeyore, and now we're going on to see Owl.
Eeyore: That's right. You'll like Owl. He flew past a day or two ago and noticed me. He didn't actually say anything, mind you, but he knew it was me. Very friendly of him, I thought. Encouraging.
Pooh and Piglet: Well, good-bye, Eeyore
Eeyore: Good-bye. Mind you don't get blown away, little Piglet. You'd be missed. People would say 'Where's little Piglet been blown to?' --really wanting to know. Well, good-bye. And thank you for happening to pass me.
Pooh and Piglet: Good-bye
###
Pooh: Good-bye
Piglet: Good-bye
Piglet: Supposing a tree fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?
Pooh: Supposing it didn't
Pooh: Hallo, Owl, I hope we're not too late for----I mean, how are you, Owl? Piglet and I just came to see how you were, because it's Thursday.
Owl: Sit down, Pooh, sit down, Piglet. Make yourselves comfortable.
Pooh: Because, you see, Owl, we've been hurrying, so as to be in time for--so as to see you before we went away again.
Owl: Correct me if I am wrong, but am I right in supposing that it is a very Blusterous day outside?
Piglet: Very
Owl: I thought so. It was on just such a blusterous day as this that my Uncle Robert, a portrait of whom you see upon the wall on your right, Piglet, while returning in the late forenoon from a----What's that?
Pooh: Look out! Mind the clock! Out of the way, Piglet! Piglet, I'm falling on you!
Piglet: Help!
###
Pooh: Look out! Mind the clock! Out of the way, Piglet! Piglet, I'm falling on you!
Piglet: Help!
Piglet: Pooh
Pooh: Yes?
Piglet: Where are we?
Pooh: I'm not quite sure
Piglet: Are we--are we in Owl's House?
Pooh: I think so, because we were just going to have tea, and we hadn't had it.
Piglet: Oh! Well, did Owl _always_ have a letter-box in his ceiling?
Pooh: Has he?
Piglet: Yes, look.
Pooh: I can't. I'm face downwards under something, and that, Piglet, is a very bad position for looking at ceilings.
Piglet: Well, he has, Pooh.
Pooh: Perhaps he's changed it. Just for a change.
Owl: Ah, Piglet, where's Pooh?
Pooh: I'm not quite sure.
Owl: Pooh, did _you_ do that?
Pooh: No, I don't _think_ so.
Owl: Then who did?
###
Pooh: I'm not quite sure.
Owl: Pooh, did _you_ do that?
Pooh: No, I don't _think_ so.
Owl: Then who did?
Piglet: I think it was the wind. I think your house has blown down.
Owl: Oh, is that it? I thought it was Pooh.
Pooh: No.
Owl: If it was the wind, then it wasn't Pooh's fault. No blame can be attached to him.
Pooh: Piglet!
Piglet: Yes, Pooh?
Pooh: _What_ did he say was attached to me?
Piglet: He said he didn't blame you.
Pooh: Oh! I thought he meant--Oh, I see.
Piglet: Owl, come down and help Pooh.
Owl: Well! This is a nice state of things!
Piglet: What are we going to do, Pooh? Can you think of anything?
Pooh: Well, I _had_ just thought of something. It was just a little thing I thought of.
Pooh: I lay on my chest And I thought it best To pretend I was having an evening rest; I lay on my tum And I tried to hum But nothing particular seemed to come. My face was flat On the floor, and that Is all very well for an acrobat; But it doesn't seem fair To a Friendly Bear To stiffen him out with a basket-chair. And a sort of sqoze Which grows and grows Is not too nice for his poor old nose, And a sort of squch Is much too much For his neck and his mouth and his ears and such.
Pooh: That was all.
Owl: If Pooh was sure that _was_ all, they could now give their minds to the Problem of Escape.
Owl: Because, we can't go out by what used to be the front door. Something's fallen on it.
Piglet: But how else _can_ you go out?
###
Owl: Because we can't go out by what used to be the front door. Something's fallen on it.
Piglet: But how else _can_ you go out?
Owl: That is the Problem, Piglet, to which I am asking Pooh to give his mind.
Pooh: Could you fly up to the letter-box with Piglet on your back?
Piglet: No, he couldn't.
Pooh: Because you see, Owl, if we could get Piglet into the letter-box, he might squeeze through the place where the letters come, and climb down the tree and run for help.
Piglet: But you said the necessary you-know-whats _wouldn't_.
Owl: No, they _won't_, so it's no good thinking about it.
Piglet: Then we'd better think of something else.
Pooh: Owl, I have thought of something.
Owl: Astute and Helpful Bear.
###
Pooh: Owl, I have thought of something.
Owl: Astute and Helpful Bear.
Owl: And there Piglet is, if the string doesn't break.
Piglet: Supposing it does?
Owl: Then we try another piece of string.
Piglet: It was a Very Clever pup-pup-pup Clever pup-pup Plan.
Pooh: It won't break, because you're a Small Animal, and I'll stand underneath, and if you save us all, it will be a Very Grand Thing to talk about afterwards, and perhaps I'll make up a Song, and people will say 'It was so grand what Piglet did that a Respectful Pooh Song was made about it.
Pooh: Up we go!
###
Pooh: Up we go!
Owl: The ascent is proceeding as expected.
Piglet: It's all right. Your tree is blown right over, Owl, and there's a branch across the door, but Christopher Robin and I can move it, and we'll bring a rope for Pooh, and I'll go and tell him now, and I can climb down quite easily, I mean it's dangerous but I can do it all right, and Christopher Robin and I will be back in about half-an-hour. Good-bye, Pooh!
Owl: Half-an-hour. That will just give me time to finish that story I was telling you about my Uncle Robert--a portrait of whom you see underneath you. Now let me see, where was I? Oh, yes. It was on just such a blusterous day as this that my Uncle Robert----
###
Rabbit: I'm leaving one for all the others, and telling them what it means, and they'll all search too. I'm in a hurry, good-bye.
Pooh: But it isn't Easy, because Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get _you_. And all you can do is to go where they can find you.
Pooh: Well, I shall begin '_Here lies a tree_' because it does, and then I'll see what happens.
###
Piglet: Help for Owl, a bird And Pooh, a bear!
Piglet: Help-help and Rescue!
Pooh: So there it is.
Eeyore: What's all this?
Rabbit: What's the matter with his old house?
Eeyore: Nobody tells me. Nobody keeps me Informed. I make it seventeen days come Friday since anybody spoke to me.
Rabbit: It certainly isn't seventeen days----
Eeyore: Come Friday.
Rabbit: And today's Saturday. So that would make it eleven days. And I was here myself a week ago.
Eeyore: Not conversing. Not first one and then the other. You said 'Hallo' and Flashed Past. I saw your tail in the distance as I was meditating my reply. I _had_ thought of saying 'What?' --but, of course, it was then too late.
Rabbit: Well, I was in a hurry.
Eeyore: No Give and Take. No Exchange of Thought: '_Hallo--What_'----I mean, it gets you nowhere, particularly if the other person's tail is only just in sight for the second half of the conversation.
Rabbit: It's your fault, Eeyore. You've never been to see any of us. You just stay here in this one corner of the Forest waiting for the others to come to _you_. Why don't you go to _them_ sometimes?
Eeyore: There may be something in what you say, Rabbit. I must move about more. I must come and go.
###
Eeyore: There may be something in what you say, Rabbit. I must move about more. I must come and go.
Rabbit: That's right, Eeyore. Drop in on any of us at any time, when you feel like it.
Eeyore: Thank-you, Rabbit. And if anybody says in a Loud Voice 'Bother, it's Eeyore,' I can drop out again.
Rabbit: Well, I must be going.
Eeyore: Good-bye.
Rabbit: What? Oh, good-bye. And if you do come across a house for Owl, you must let us know.
Eeyore: I will give my mind to it.
Pooh: Piglet.
Piglet: Yes, Pooh?
Pooh: Do you remember when I said that a Respectful Pooh Song might be written about You Know What?
Piglet: Did you, Pooh? Oh, yes, I believe you did.
Pooh: It's been written, Piglet.
Piglet: Has it, Pooh? About--about----That Time When?----Do you mean really written?
Pooh: Yes, Piglet.
Pooh: There are seven verses in it.
Piglet: Seven? You don't often get seven verses in a Hum, do you, Pooh?
Pooh: Never, I don't suppose it's ever been heard of before.
Piglet: Do the Others know yet?
Pooh: No. And I wondered which you would like best. For me to hum it now, or to wait till we find the others, and then hum it to all of you.
###
Pooh: No, and I wondered which you would like best. For me to hum it now, or to wait till we find the others, and then hum it to all of you.
Piglet: I think what I'd like best, Pooh, is I'd like you to hum it to me now--and--and then to hum it to all of us. Because then Everybody would hear it, but I could say 'Oh, yes, Pooh's told me,' and pretend not to be listening.
Piglet: Did I really do all that?
Pooh: Well, in poetry--in a piece of poetry--well, you did it, Piglet, because the poetry says you did. And that's how people know.
Piglet: Oh! Because I--I thought I did blinch a little. Just at first. And it says, 'Did he blinch no no.' That's why.
Pooh: You only blinched inside, and that's the bravest way for a Very Small Animal not to blinch that there is.

Pooh: You only blinched inside, and that's the bravest way for a Very Small Animal not to blinch that there is.
Kanga: You won't want this dirty old dish-cloth any more, will you, and what about this carpet, it's all in holes.
Owl: Of course I do! It's just a question of arranging the furniture properly, and it isn't a dish-cloth, it's my shawl.
Kanga: Your house is a Disgrace, all damp and dirty, and it was quite time it did tumble down. Look at that horrid bunch of toadstools growing out of the floor there!
Owl: That was my sponge, and if people didn't know a perfectly ordinary bath-sponge when they saw it, things were coming to a pretty pass.
Roo: I must see Owl's sponge! Oh, there it is! Oh, Owl! Owl, it isn't a sponge, it's a spudge!
Kanga: Roo, dear!
###
Roo: Do you know what a spudge is, Owl? It's when your sponge gets all----
Kanga: Roo, dear!
Piglet: It _is_ good, isn't it? I mean as a song.
Pooh: And what about the new house? Have you found it, Owl?
Christopher Robin: He's found a name for it, so now all he wants is the house.
Owl: I am calling it this.
Owl: Oh, it's you.
Rabbit: Hallo, Eeyore! _There_ you are! Where have _you_ been?
Eeyore: Good morning, Christopher Robin. Are we alone?
Christopher Robin: Yes.
Eeyore: I have been told--the news has worked through to my corner of the Forest--the damp bit down on the right which nobody wants--that a certain Person is looking for a house. I have found one for him.
Rabbit: Ah, well done.
Eeyore: We have been joined by something. But no matter. We can leave it behind. If you will come with me, Christopher Robin, I will show you the house.
Christopher Robin: Come on, Pooh.
Roo: Come on, Tigger!
Rabbit: Shall we go, Owl?
Owl: Wait a moment.
###
Pooh: Well, it's a very nice house, and if your own house is blown down, you must go somewhere else, mustn't you, Piglet? What would you do, if your house was blown down?
Pooh: He'd come and live with me, wouldn't you, Piglet?
Piglet: Thank you, Pooh, I should love to.
Eeyore: Well, this is a surprise. Am I asked too?
Rabbit: Don't mind Eeyore. I told him all about it this morning.
###
Eeyore: If anybody wants to clap, now is the time to do it.
Eeyore: Thank you. Unexpected and gratifying, if a little lacking in Smack.
Pooh: It's much better than mine.
Eeyore: Well, it was meant to be.
Rabbit: The rissolution is that we all sign it, and take it to Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin: Hallo, everybody. Hallo, Pooh.
Christopher Robin: What is it, Eeyore?
###
Christopher Robin: What is it, Eeyore?
Eeyore: Christopher Robin, we've come to say--to give you--it's called--written by--but we've all--because we've heard, I mean we all know--well, you see, it's--we--you--well, that, to put it as shortly as possible, is what it is.
Eeyore: Everybody crowds round so in this Forest. There's no Space. I never saw a more Spreading lot of animals in my life, and all in the wrong places. Can't you _see_ that Christopher Robin wants to be alone? I'm going.
Christopher Robin: It's a comforting sort of thing to have.
Christopher Robin: Come on, Pooh.
Pooh: Where are we going?
Christopher Robin: Nowhere.
Christopher Robin: What do you like doing best in the world, Pooh?
###
Christopher Robin: Nowhere
Christopher Robin: What do you like doing best in the world, Pooh?
Pooh: What I like best in the whole world is Me and Piglet going to see You, and You saying 'What about a little something?' and Me saying, 'Well, I shouldn't mind a little something, should you, Piglet,' and it being a hummy sort of day outside, and birds singing.
Christopher Robin: I like that too, but what I like _doing_ best is Nothing.
Pooh: How do you do Nothing?
Christopher Robin: Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it, What are you going to do, Christopher Robin, and you say, Oh, nothing, and then you go and do it.
Pooh: Oh, I see.
Christopher Robin: This is a nothing sort of thing that we're doing now.
Pooh: Oh, I see.
Christopher Robin: It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering.
Pooh: Oh!
###
Pooh: Oh, I see
Unknown: This is a nothing sort of thing that we're doing now.
Pooh: Oh, I see
Unknown: It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering.
Pooh: Oh!
Pooh: Oh!
Pooh: I didn't know
Pooh: Is it a very Grand thing to be an Afternoon, what you said?
Christopher Robin: A what?
Pooh: On a horse
Christopher Robin: A Knight?
###
Pooh: Is it a very Grand thing to be an Afternoon, what you said?
Christopher Robin: A what?
Pooh: On a horse.
Christopher Robin: A Knight?
Pooh: Oh, was that it? I thought it was a----Is it as Grand as a King and Factors and all the other things you said?
Christopher Robin: Well, it's not as grand as a King, but it's grander than Factors.
Pooh: Could a Bear be one?
Christopher Robin: Of course he could! I'll make you one.
Christopher Robin: Rise, Sir Pooh de Bear, most faithful of all my Knights.
Pooh: Thank you.
Christopher Robin: Pooh!
Pooh: Yes?
Christopher Robin: When I'm- when--- Pooh!
Pooh: Yes, Christopher Robin?
Christopher Robin: I'm not going to do Nothing any more.
Pooh: Never again?
Christopher Robin: Well, not so much. They don't let you.
Pooh: Yes, Christopher Robin?
###
Christopher Robin: Pooh!
Pooh: Yes, Christopher Robin?
Christopher Robin: I'm not going to do Nothing any more.
Pooh: Never again?
Christopher Robin: Well, not so much. They don't let you.
Pooh: Yes, Christopher Robin?
Christopher Robin: Pooh, when I'm--_you_ know--when I'm _not_ doing Nothing, will you come up here sometimes?
Pooh: Just Me?
Christopher Robin: Yes, Pooh.
Pooh: Will you be here too?
Christopher Robin: Yes, Pooh, I will be, _really_. I _promise_ I will be, Pooh.
Pooh: That's good.
Christopher Robin: Pooh, _promise_ you won't forget about me, ever. Not even when I'm a hundred.
Pooh: How old shall _I_ be then?
Christopher Robin: Ninety-nine.
Pooh: I promise.
Christopher Robin: Pooh, if I--if I'm not quite----Pooh, _whatever_ happens, you _will_ understand, won't you?
Pooh: Understand what?
Christopher Robin: Oh, nothing. Come on!
Pooh: Where?
Christopher Robin: Anywhere.
###
Christopher Robin: Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure
Pooh: Now I am
Pooh: That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.
Pooh: And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.
Pooh: And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.
Pooh: Isn't it funny How a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does?
Pooh: It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees. And that being so (if the Bees were Bears), We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.
Pooh: Oh, help!
Pooh: If only I hadn't----
###
Pooh: Oh, help!
Pooh: If only I hadn't----
Pooh: You see, what I _meant_ to do, what I _meant_ to do----
Pooh: Of course, it _was_ rather----
Pooh: It all comes, I suppose, it all comes of _liking_ honey so much. Oh, help!
Christopher Robin: Was that me?
Narrator: That was you.
Pooh: Good morning, Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin: Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh.
Pooh: I wonder if you've got such a thing as a balloon about you?
Christopher Robin: A balloon?
Pooh: Yes, I just said to myself coming along: 'I wonder if Christopher Robin has such a thing as a balloon about him?' I just said it to myself, thinking of balloons, and wondering.
Christopher Robin: What do you want a balloon for?
Pooh: Honey!
Christopher Robin: But you don't get honey with balloons!
Pooh: _I_ do.
###
You: What do you want a balloon for?
Pooh: Honey!
You: But you don't get honey with balloons!
Pooh: I do.
You: Which one would you like?
Pooh: It's like this. When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now, if you have a green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and not notice you, and, if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is: Which is most likely?
You: Wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon?
Pooh: They might or they might not. You never can tell with bees. I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That will deceive them.
You: Then you had better have the blue balloon.
You: Hooray!
Pooh: Isn't that fine? What do I look like?
###
Christopher Robin: No.
Pooh: A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying, 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud Song, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!
Pooh: How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue! Every little cloud _Always_ sings aloud.
Pooh: How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue! It makes him very proud To be a little cloud.
Pooh: Christopher--_ow!_--Robin
Christopher Robin: Yes?
Pooh: I have just been thinking, and I have come to a very important decision. _These are the wrong sort of bees._
Christopher Robin: Are they?
Pooh: Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they would make the wrong sort of honey, shouldn't you?
Christopher Robin: Would they?
Pooh: Yes. So I think I shall come down.
Christopher Robin: How?
Pooh: Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun. Have you got your gun?
Christopher Robin: Of course I have. But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon.
Pooh: But if you _don't_, I shall have to let go, and that would spoil _me_.
Christopher Robin: Did I miss?
Pooh: You didn't exactly _miss_, but you missed the _balloon_.
Christopher Robin: I'm so sorry.
###
Pooh: You didn't exactly _miss_, but you missed the _balloon_.
Christopher Robin: Is that the end of the story?
Narrator: That's the end of that one. There are others.
Christopher Robin: About Pooh and Me?
Narrator: And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you. Don't you remember?
Christopher Robin: I do remember, and then when I try to remember, I forget.
Christopher Robin: That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump----
Christopher Robin: They didn't catch it, did they?
Narrator: No.
Christopher Robin: Pooh couldn't, because he hasn't any brain. Did _I_ catch it?
Narrator: Well, that comes into the story.
Christopher Robin: I do remember, only Pooh doesn't very well, so that's why he likes having it told to him again. Because then it's a real story and not just a remembering.
Narrator: That's just how _I_ feel.
Christopher Robin: Coming to see me have my bath?
Narrator: I might.
Christopher Robin: I didn't hurt him when I shot him, did I?
Narrator: Not a bit.
###
Unknown: I didn't hurt him when I shot him, did I?
Unknown: Not a bit.
Pooh: Aha! If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit, and Rabbit means Company, and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such like. _Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um._
Pooh: Is anybody at home?
Pooh: What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'
Rabbit: No! You needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time.
Pooh: Bother! Isn't there anybody here at all?
Rabbit: Nobody.
###
Pooh: What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'
Voice: No! You needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time.
Pooh: Bother! Isn't there anybody here at all?
Voice: Nobody.
Pooh: Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?
Rabbit: No.
Pooh: But isn't that Rabbit's voice?
Rabbit: I don't _think_ so. It isn't _meant_ to be.
Pooh: Oh!
Pooh: Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?
Rabbit: He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his.
Pooh: But this _is_ Me!
Rabbit: What sort of Me?
Pooh: Pooh Bear.
Rabbit: Are you sure?
Pooh: Quite, quite sure.
Rabbit: Oh, well, then, come in.
Rabbit: You were quite right. It _is_ you. Glad to see you.
Pooh: Who did you think it was?
Rabbit: Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can't have _anybody_ coming into one's house. One has to be _careful_. What about a mouthful of something?
Rabbit: Honey or condensed milk with your bread?
Pooh: Both. But don't bother about the bread, please.
Rabbit: Must you?
###
Rabbit: Must you?
Pooh: Well, I could stay a little longer if it--if you----
Rabbit: As a matter of fact, I was going out myself directly.
Pooh: Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye.
Rabbit: Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more.
Pooh: _Is_ there any more?
Rabbit: No, there wasn't.
Pooh: I thought not. Well, good-bye. I must be going on.
Pooh: Oh, help! I'd better go back.
Pooh: Oh, bother! I shall have to go on.
Pooh: I can't do either! Oh, help _and_ bother!
Rabbit: Hallo, are you stuck?
Pooh: N-no. Just resting and thinking and humming to myself.
Rabbit: Here, give us a paw.
Pooh: _Ow!_ You're hurting!
Rabbit: The fact is, you're stuck.
Pooh: It all comes of not having front doors big enough.
Rabbit: It all comes of eating too much. I thought at the time, only I didn't like to say anything, that one of us was eating too much, and I knew it wasn't _me_. Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin: Silly old Bear.
###
Christopher Robin: Silly old Bear
Pooh: I was just beginning to think that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should _hate_ that.
Rabbit: So should I.
Christopher Robin: Use his front door again? Of course he'll use his front door again.
Rabbit: Good.
Christopher Robin: If we can't pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.
Pooh: You mean I'd _never_ get out?
Rabbit: I mean that having got _so_ far, it seems a pity to waste it.
Christopher Robin: Then there's only one thing to be done. We shall have to wait for you to get thin again.
Pooh: How long does getting thin take?
Christopher Robin: About a week, I should think.
Pooh: But I can't stay here for a _week_!
Christopher Robin: You can _stay_ here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out which is so difficult.
Rabbit: We'll read to you. And I hope it won't snow. And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room in my house--_do_ you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are--doing nothing--and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them.
Pooh: A week! _What about meals?_
Christopher Robin: I'm afraid no meals, because of getting thin quicker. But we _will_ read to you.
Pooh: Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?
###
Pooh: Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?
Christopher Robin: Now!
Pooh: Ow!
Pooh: Oh!
Pooh: Pop!
Christopher Robin: Silly old Bear!
Christopher Robin: You couldn't be called Trespassers W
Piglet: Yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William.
Christopher Robin: I've got two names.
###
Christopher Robin: I've got two names
Piglet: Well, there you are, that proves it
Piglet: Hallo! what are _you_ doing?
Pooh: Hunting
Piglet: Hunting what?
Pooh: Tracking something
Piglet: Tracking what?
Pooh: That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?
Piglet: What do you think you'll answer?
Pooh: I shall have to wait until I catch up with it. Now, look there. What do you see there?
Piglet: Tracks. Paw-marks. Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?
Pooh: It may be. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks.
Piglet: What's the matter?
Pooh: It's a very funny thing, but there seem to be _two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?
Pooh: You mean, in case it really is two Woozles
###
Pooh: Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. Another Woozle has joined them!
Piglet: I think that I have just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now.
Pooh: We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you.
Piglet: It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon. It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you say the time was?
Pooh: About twelve.
Piglet: Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me----What's that?
Pooh: It's Christopher Robin.
Piglet: Ah, then you'll be all right. You'll be quite safe with him. Good-bye.
Christopher Robin: Silly old Bear, what were you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time----
Pooh: Wait a moment.
Pooh: Yes.
###
Eeyore: What _has_ happened to it?
Pooh: It isn't there!
Eeyore: Are you sure?
Pooh: Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn't there. You can't make a mistake about it. And yours _isn't_ there!
Eeyore: Then what is?
Pooh: Nothing.
Eeyore: Let's have a look.
Eeyore: I believe you're right.
Pooh: Of course I'm right.
Eeyore: That Accounts for a Good Deal. It Explains Everything. No Wonder.
Pooh: You must have left it somewhere.
Eeyore: Somebody must have taken it. How Like Them.
Pooh: Eeyore, I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you.
Eeyore: Thank you, Pooh. You're a real friend. Not like Some.
###
Bear: And if anyone knows anything about anything, it's Owl who knows something about something, or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh.
Bear: Which it is.
Bear: So there you are.
Bear: Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking.
Owl: Hallo, Pooh. How's things?
Pooh: Terrible and Sad, because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?
Owl: Well, the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.
Pooh: What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean? For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me.
Owl: It means the Thing to Do.
Pooh: As long as it means that, I don't mind.
Owl: The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then----
Pooh: Just a moment. What do we do to this--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me.
Owl: I didn't sneeze.
Pooh: Yes, you did, Owl.
###
Owl: The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then----
Pooh: Just a moment. _What_ do we do to this--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me.
Owl: I _didn't_ sneeze.
Pooh: Yes, you did, Owl.
Owl: Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.
Pooh: Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.
Owl: What I _said_ was, 'First _Issue_ a Reward'.
Pooh: You're doing it again.
Owl: A Reward! We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore's tail.
Pooh: I see, I see. Talking about large somethings, I generally have a small something about now--about this time in the morning, just a mouthful of condensed milk or whatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey----
Owl: Well, then, we write out this notice, and we put it up all over the forest.
Pooh: A lick of honey, or--or not, as the case may be.
Owl: It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me. Did you see them, Pooh?
Pooh: No, not at all.
Owl: Didn't you see them? Come and look at them now.
###
Owl: Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?
Pooh: It reminds me of something, but I can't think what. Where did you get it?
Owl: I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and----
Pooh: Owl, you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.
Owl: Who?
Pooh: Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was--he was fond of it.
Owl: Fond of it?
Pooh: Attached to it.
Christopher Robin: I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet.
Piglet: What was it doing?
Christopher Robin: Just lumping along. I don't think it saw me.
Piglet: I saw one once. At least, I think I did. Only perhaps it wasn't.
Pooh: So did I.
Christopher Robin: You don't often see them.
Piglet: Not now.
Pooh: Not at this time of year.
###
Pooh: So did I.
Christopher Robin: You don't often see them.
Piglet: Not now.
Pooh: Not at this time of year.
Piglet: If you see what I mean, Pooh
Pooh: It's just what I think myself, Piglet
Piglet: But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember
Pooh: Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment.
Pooh: Piglet, I have decided something.
Piglet: What have you decided, Pooh?
Pooh: I have decided to catch a Heffalump.
Pooh: I shall do it by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.
Piglet: Pooh, I will.
Piglet: How shall we do it?
Pooh: That's just it. How?
Piglet: Why?
Pooh: Why what?
Piglet: Why would he fall in?
###
Piglet: Why?
Pooh: Why what?
Piglet: Why would he fall in?
Piglet: Supposing it were raining already?
Piglet: Now that this point had been explained, I think it is a Cunning Trap.
Pooh: But then he would see us digging it.
Piglet: Not if he was looking at the sky.
Pooh: He would Suspect if he happened to look down.
Pooh: It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Heffalumps hardly ever get caught.
Piglet: That must be it.
Pooh: Suppose you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?
###
Pooh: Suppose, you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?
Piglet: Well, I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and----
Pooh: And I would go in after it, only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then----
Piglet: Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of----I say, wake up, Pooh!
Pooh: Honey is a much more trappy thing than Haycorns.
Piglet: All right, honey then.
Piglet: Honey. I'll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey.
Pooh: Very well.
###
Piglet: Honey
Piglet: I'll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey.
Pooh: Very well
Pooh: But you never can tell
Pooh: I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour.
Pooh: Yes, it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course, somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a little further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps don't like cheese ... same as me.... Ah! I was right. It is honey, right the way down.
Piglet: Got it?
Pooh: Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar
Piglet: No, it isn't! Is that all you've got left?
Pooh: Yes.
Piglet: Well, good night, Pooh
Piglet: And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap.
Pooh: Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?
Piglet: No. Why do you want string?
Pooh: To lead them home with.
Piglet: Oh! ... I think Heffalumps come if you whistle.
Pooh: Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!
Piglet: Good night!
###
Pooh: Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.
Piglet: Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!
Pooh: Good night!
Pooh: That's funny, I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that I should know it was honey. That's very funny.
Pooh: Bother! It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.
Pooh: Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better.
###
Pooh: Bother! A Heffalump has been eating it!
Pooh: Oh, no, I did. I forgot.
Piglet: Oh!
Piglet: Yes
Piglet: Quite so
###
Piglet: Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
Pooh: Bother!
Pooh: Oh, help!
Pooh: Ow!
Piglet: Help, help! a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!
Piglet: Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!
Christopher Robin: Whatever's the matter, Piglet?
Piglet: Heff, a Heff--a Heffalump.
Christopher Robin: Where?
Piglet: Up there.
Christopher Robin: What did it look like?
###
Piglet: Heff, a Heff--a Heff--a Heffalump.
Christopher Robin: Where?
Piglet: Up there.
Christopher Robin: What did it look like?
Piglet: Like--like----It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well, like a--I don't know--like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.
Christopher Robin: Well, I shall go and look at it. Come on.
Piglet: I can hear it, can't you?
Christopher Robin: I can hear _something_.
Piglet: There! Isn't it _awful_?
Christopher Robin: Oh, Bear! How I do love you!
Pooh: So do I.
Eeyore: Pathetic. That's what it is. Pathetic.
Eeyore: As I thought. No better from _this_ side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.
Pooh: Good morning, Eeyore.
###
Eeyore: As I thought. No better from this side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.
Pooh: Good morning, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Good morning, Pooh Bear. If it is a good morning. Which I doubt.
Pooh: Why, what's the matter?
Eeyore: Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't. That's all there is to it.
Pooh: Can't all what?
Eeyore: Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush.
Pooh: Oh! What mulberry bush is that?
Eeyore: Bon-hommy. French word meaning bonhommy. I'm not complaining, but There It Is.
Pooh: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie."
Pooh: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, A fish can't whistle and neither can I. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie."
Pooh: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, Why does a chicken, I don't know why. Ask me a riddle and I reply: "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie."
Eeyore: That's right. Sing. Umty-tiddly, umty-too. Here we go gathering Nuts and May. Enjoy yourself.
Pooh: I am.
Eeyore: Some can.
Pooh: Why, what's the matter? Is anything the matter?
Pooh: You seem so sad, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year.
###
Pooh: I am
Eeyore: Some can
Pooh: Why, what's the matter?
Pooh: Is anything the matter?
Pooh: You seem so sad, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year.
Pooh: Your birthday?
Eeyore: Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had. Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink sugar.
Pooh: Presents? Birthday cake? Where?
Eeyore: Can't you see them?
Pooh: No
Eeyore: Neither can I. Joke. Ha ha!
Pooh: But is it really your birthday?
Eeyore: It is.
Pooh: Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.
Eeyore: And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.
Pooh: But it isn't my birthday.
Eeyore: No, it's mine.
Pooh: But you said 'Many happy returns'----
Eeyore: Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do you?
Pooh: Oh, I see.
Eeyore: It's bad enough being miserable myself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper notice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be miserable too----
Pooh: Stay there!
Pooh: Hallo, Piglet
Piglet: Hallo, Pooh
Pooh: What are you trying to do?
Piglet: I was trying to reach the knocker. I just came round----
###
Pooh: Hallo, Piglet
Piglet: Hallo, Pooh
Pooh: What are _you_ trying to do?
Piglet: I was trying to reach the knocker. I just came round----
Pooh: Let me do it for you.
Pooh: I have just seen Eeyore, and poor Eeyore is in a Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice of it, and he's very Gloomy--you know what Eeyore is--and there he was, and----What a long time whoever lives here is answering this door.
Piglet: But Pooh, it's your own house!
Pooh: Oh! So it is. Well, let's go in.
Pooh: I'm giving this to Eeyore, as a present. What are _you_ going to give?
Piglet: Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?
Pooh: No. That would _not_ be a good plan.
Piglet: All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party. I'll go and get it now, shall I?
Pooh: That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.
###
Pooh: Dear, dear, I didn't know it was as late as that.
Pooh: Lucky I brought this with me. Many a bear going out on a warm day like this would never have thought of bringing a little something with him.
Pooh: Now let me see, where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.
Pooh: Bother! What shall I do? I must give him something.
Pooh: Good morning, Owl.
Owl: Good morning, Pooh.
Pooh: Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday.
Owl: Oh, is that what it is?
Pooh: What are you giving him, Owl?
Owl: What are you giving him, Pooh?
Pooh: I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask you----
Owl: Is this it?
Pooh: Yes, and I wanted to ask you----
Owl: Somebody has been keeping honey in it.
Pooh: You can keep anything in it. It's Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask you----
Owl: You ought to write 'A Happy Birthday' on it.
Pooh: That was what I wanted to ask you. Because my spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places. Would you write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?
Owl: It's a nice pot. Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?
Pooh: No. That would not be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it.
###
Owl: It's a nice pot. Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?
Pooh: No. That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it.
Owl: Can you read, Pooh? There's a notice about knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Robin wrote. Could you read it?
Pooh: Christopher Robin told me what it said, and _then_ I could.
Owl: Well, I'll tell you what _this_ says, and then you'll be able to.
Owl: I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday'.
Pooh: It's a nice long one.
Owl: Well, _actually_, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh.' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that.
Pooh: Oh, I see.
###
Pooh: Many happy returns of the day
Eeyore: Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them
Pooh: I've brought you a little present
Eeyore: I've had it
Pooh: It's a Useful Pot. Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that writing is. And it's for putting things in. There!
Eeyore: Why! I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!
Pooh: Oh, no, Eeyore. Balloons are much too big to go into Pots. What you do with a balloon is, you hold the balloon----
Eeyore: Not mine. Look, Piglet!
Pooh: So it does! It goes in!
Piglet: So it does! And it comes out!
Eeyore: Doesn't it? It goes in and out like anything.
Pooh: I'm very glad that I thought of giving you a Useful Pot to put things in.
Piglet: I'm very glad that I thought of giving you Something to put in a Useful Pot.
Christopher Robin: And didn't I give him anything?
Narrator: Of course you did. You gave him--don't you remember--a little--a little----
Christopher Robin: I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.
Narrator: That was it.
###
Christopher Robin: And didn't _I_ give him anything?
Narrator: Of course you did. You gave him--don't you remember--a little--a little----
Christopher Robin: I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.
Narrator: That was it.
Christopher Robin: Why didn't I give it to him in the morning?
Narrator: You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with icing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar, and----
Christopher Robin: Yes, _I_ remember.
Pooh: How did they come here?
Christopher Robin: In the Usual Way, if you know what I mean, Pooh.
Pooh: Oh! In the Usual Way. Ah!
Rabbit: What I don't like about it is this. Here are we--you, Pooh, and you, Piglet, and Me--and suddenly----
Pooh: And Eeyore.
Rabbit: And Eeyore--and then suddenly---
Pooh: And Owl.
Rabbit: And Owl--and then all of a sudden----
Pooh: Oh, and Eeyore. I was forgetting _him_.
Rabbit: Here--we--are, all--of--us, and then, suddenly, we wake up one morning and, what do we find? We find a Strange Animal among us. An animal of whom we have never even heard before! An animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket! Suppose _I_ carried _my_ family about with me in _my_ pocket, how many pockets should I want?
Piglet: Sixteen.
Rabbit: Seventeen, isn't it? And one more for a handkerchief--that's eighteen. Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven't time.
Pooh: _I_ make it fifteen.
Rabbit: What?
###
Pooh: I make it fifteen.
Rabbit: What?
Pooh: Fifteen.
Rabbit: Fifteen what?
Pooh: Your family.
Rabbit: What about them?
Pooh: Yes, you said---
Piglet: Never mind, Pooh. The question is, What are we to do about Kanga?
Pooh: Oh, I see.
Rabbit: The best way would be this. The best way would be to steal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, 'Where's Baby Roo?' we say, 'Aha!'
Pooh: Aha! Aha! ... Of course, we could say 'Aha!' even if we hadn't stolen Baby Roo.
Rabbit: Pooh, you haven't any brain.
Pooh: I know.
Rabbit: We say 'Aha!' so that Kanga knows that we know where Baby Roo is. 'Aha!' means 'We'll tell you where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go away from the Forest and never come back.' Now don't talk while I think.
Piglet: There's just one thing. I was talking to Christopher Robin, and he said that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as One of the Fiercer Animals. I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the ordinary way, but it is well known that, if One of the Fiercer Animals is Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer Animals. In which case 'Aha!' is perhaps a foolish thing to say.
Rabbit: Piglet, you haven't any pluck.
Piglet: It is hard to be brave when you're only a Very Small Animal.
###
Rabbit: Piglet, you haven't any pluck.
Piglet: It is hard to be brave when you're only a Very Small Animal.
Rabbit: It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in the adventure before us.
Pooh: What about me? I suppose _I_ shan't be useful?
Piglet: Never mind, Pooh. Another time perhaps.
Rabbit: Without Pooh, the adventure would be impossible.
Pooh: Impossible without Me! _That_ sort of Bear.
Rabbit: Now listen all of you.
###
Piglet: And- Afterwards?
Rabbit: How do you mean?
Piglet: When Kanga _does_ Discover the Difference?
Rabbit: Then we all say '_Aha!_'
Piglet: All three of us?
Rabbit: Yes.
Piglet: Oh!
Rabbit: Why, what's the trouble, Piglet?
Piglet: Nothing, as long as _we all three_ say it. As long as we all three say it, I don't mind, but I shouldn't care to say '_Aha!_' by myself. It wouldn't sound _nearly_ so well. By the way, you _are_ quite sure about what you said about the winter months?
Rabbit: The winter months?
Piglet: Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months.
Rabbit: Oh, yes, yes, that's all right. Well, Pooh? You see what you have to do?
Pooh: No, not yet. What _do_ I do?
Rabbit: Well, you just have to talk very hard to Kanga so as she doesn't notice anything.
Pooh: Oh! What about?
Rabbit: Anything you like.
Pooh: You mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something?
Rabbit: That's it. Splendid. Now come along.
Pooh: Good afternoon, Kanga.
Kanga: Good afternoon, Pooh.
Roo: Look at me jumping.
Pooh: Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!
Kanga: We were just going home. Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good afternoon, Piglet.
###
Pooh: Good afternoon, Kanga.
Kanga: Good afternoon, Pooh.
Roo: Look at me jumping.
Pooh: Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!
Kanga: We were just going home. Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good afternoon, Piglet.
Rabbit: Good afternoon.
Piglet: Good afternoon.
Roo: Look at me jumping.
Pooh: Oh, Kanga, I don't know if you are interested in Poetry at all?
Kanga: Hardly at all.
Pooh: Oh!
Kanga: Roo, dear, just one more jump and then we must go home.
Rabbit: Go on.
Pooh: Talking of Poetry, I made up a little piece as I was coming along. It went like this. Er--now let me see----
Kanga: Fancy! Now Roo, dear----
Rabbit: You'll like this piece of poetry.
Piglet: You'll love it.
Rabbit: You must listen very carefully.
Piglet: So as not to miss any of it.
Kanga: Oh, yes.
Rabbit: How did it go, Pooh?
Pooh: On Monday, when the sun is hot I wonder to myself a lot: "Now is it true, or is it not, "That what is which and which is what?"
Pooh: On Tuesday, when it hails and snows, The feeling on me grows and grows That hardly anybody knows If those are these or these are those.
Pooh: On Wednesday, when the sky is blue, And I have nothing else to do, I sometimes wonder if it's true That who is what and what is who.
Pooh: On Thursday, when it starts to freeze And hoar-frost twinkles on the trees, How very readily one sees That these are whose--but whose are these?
Kanga: Yes, it is, isn't it? Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really must be going.
###
Kanga: Yes, it is, isn't it? Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really _must_ be going.
Rabbit: Talking of Poetry, have you ever noticed that tree right over there?
Kanga: Where? Now, Roo----
Pooh: Right over there.
Kanga: No. Now jump in, Roo, dear, and we'll go home.
Rabbit: You ought to look at that tree right over there. Shall I lift you in, Roo?
Pooh: I can see a bird in it from here. Or is it a fish?
Rabbit: You ought to see that bird from here. Unless it's a fish.
Piglet: It isn't a fish, it's a bird.
Rabbit: So it is.
Pooh: Is it a starling or a blackbird?
Rabbit: That's the whole question. Is it a blackbird or a starling?
Kanga: Why, where's Rabbit? Are you all right, Roo, dear?
Piglet: [makes a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga's pocket]
Pooh: Rabbit had to go away. I think he thought of something he had to go and see about suddenly.
Kanga: And Piglet?
Pooh: I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly.
Kanga: Well, we must be getting home. Good-bye, Pooh.
###
Pooh: Good-morning, Christopher Robin
Christopher Robin: Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get this boot on.
Pooh: That's bad.
###
Pooh: Good-morning, Christopher Robin
Christopher Robin: Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get this boot on.
Pooh: That's bad.
Christopher Robin: Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, 'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over backwards.
Pooh: And that's that. What do we do next?
Christopher Robin: We are all going on an Expedition. Thank you, Pooh.
Pooh: Going on an Expotition? I don't think I've ever been on one of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?
Christopher Robin: Expedition, silly old Bear. It's got an 'x' in it.
Pooh: Oh! I know.
Pooh: Oh! What _is_ the North Pole?
Christopher Robin: It's just a thing you discover.
Pooh: Oh! I see. Are bears any good at discovering it?
Christopher Robin: Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It's an Expedition. That's what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody. You'd better tell the others to get ready, while I see if my gun's all right. And we must all bring Provisions.
Pooh: Bring what?
Christopher Robin: Things to eat.
Pooh: Oh! I thought you said Provisions. I'll go and tell them.
Pooh: Hallo, Rabbit, is that you?
Rabbit: Let's pretend it isn't, and see what happens.
Pooh: I've got a message for you.
Rabbit: I'll give it to him.
Pooh: We're all going on an Expotition with Christopher Robin!
Rabbit: What is it when we're on it?
Pooh: A sort of boat, I think.
Rabbit: Oh! that sort.
Pooh: Yes. And we're going to discover a Pole or something. Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we're going to discover it.
Rabbit: We are, are we?
###
Pooh: A sort of boat, I think.
Rabbit: We are, are we?
Pooh: Yes. And we've got to bring Pro--things to eat with us. In case we want to eat them. Now I'm going down to Piglet's. Tell Kanga, will you?
Pooh: Oh! Piglet, we're going on an Expotition, all of us, with things to eat. To discover something.
Piglet: To discover what?
Pooh: Oh! just something.
Piglet: Nothing fierce?
Pooh: Christopher Robin didn't say anything about fierce. He just said it had an 'x'.
Piglet: It isn't their necks I mind. It's their teeth. But if Christopher Robin is coming I don't mind anything.
Rabbit: I didn't ask them. They just came. They always do. They can march at the end, after Eeyore.
Eeyore: What I say is that it's unsettling. I didn't want to come on this Expo--what Pooh said. I only came to oblige. But here I am; and if I am the end of the Expo--what we're talking about--then let me be the end. But if, every time I want to sit down for a little rest, I have to brush away half a dozen of Rabbit's smaller friends-and-relations first, then this isn't an Expo--whatever it is--at all, it's simply a Confused Noise. That's what I say.
###
Owl: I see what Eeyore means. If you ask me----
Eeyore: I'm not asking anybody. I'm just telling everybody. We can look for the North Pole, or we can play 'Here we go gathering Nuts and May' with the end part of an ant's nest. It's all the same to me.
Christopher Robin: Come on!
Pooh: Come on!
Piglet: Come on!
Owl: Come on!
Rabbit: We're starting. I must go.
Eeyore: All right. We're going. Only Don't Blame Me.
Pooh: This is the first verse.
Piglet: First verse of what?
Pooh: My song.
Piglet: What song?
Pooh: This one.
Piglet: Which one?
Pooh: Well, if you listen, Piglet, you'll hear it.
Piglet: How do you know I'm not listening?
Christopher Robin: Hush! we're just coming to a Dangerous Place.
Pooh: Hush!
Piglet: Hush!
Kanga: Hush!
Owl: Hush!
Roo: Hush!
###
Pooh: Hush!
Piglet: Hush!
Kanga: Hush!
Roo: Hush!
Owl: Hush!
Eeyore: _Hush!_
Christopher Robin: It's just the place for an Ambush.
Pooh: What sort of bush? A gorse-bush?
Owl: My dear Pooh, don't you know what an Ambush is?
Piglet: Owl, Pooh's whisper was a perfectly private whisper, and there was no need----
Owl: An Ambush is a sort of Surprise.
Pooh: So is a gorse-bush sometimes.
Piglet: An Ambush, as I was about to explain to Pooh, is a sort of Surprise.
Owl: If people jump out at you suddenly, that's an Ambush.
Piglet: It's an Ambush, Pooh, when people jump at you suddenly.
Pooh: A gorse-bush had sprung at me suddenly one day when I fell off a tree, and it took six days to get all the prickles out of myself.
Owl: We are not _talking_ about gorse-bushes.
Pooh: I am.
###
Owl: We are not talking about gorse-bushes
Pooh: I am
Christopher Robin: Halt!
Christopher Robin: I think that we ought to eat all our Provisions now, so that we shan't have so much to carry.
Pooh: Eat all our what?
Piglet: All that we've brought
Pooh: That's a good idea
Christopher Robin: Have you all got something?
Eeyore: All except me. As Usual. I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance?
Pooh: I believe I am. Ow! Yes, I was. I thought so.
Eeyore: Thank you, Pooh. If you've quite finished with it.
Eeyore: It don't do them any Good, you know, sitting on them. Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that another time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all the difference.
Christopher Robin: I didn't want the others to hear
Rabbit: Quite so
Christopher Robin: It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose you don't know, What does the North Pole look like?
Rabbit: Well. Now you're asking me.
Christopher Robin: I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten.
###
Rabbit: Well, now you're asking me.
Christopher Robin: I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten.
Rabbit: It's a funny thing, but I've sort of forgotten too, although I did know once.
Christopher Robin: I suppose it's just a pole stuck in the ground?
Rabbit: Sure to be a pole, because of calling it a pole, and if it's a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground, shouldn't you, because there'd be nowhere else to stick it.
Christopher Robin: Yes, that's what I thought.
Rabbit: The only thing is, where is it sticking?
Christopher Robin: That's what we're looking for.
Eeyore: I don't hold with all this washing. This modern Behind-the-ears nonsense. What do you think, Pooh?
Pooh: Well, I think----
Eeyore: So much for washing.
Rabbit: Roo's fallen in!
Roo: Look at me swimming!
Kanga: Are you all right, Roo dear?
Roo: Yes! Look at me sw----
###
Kanga: Are you all right, Roo dear?
Roo: Yes! Look at me sw----
Piglet: Oo, I say
Owl: In a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water
Kanga: Are you _sure_ you're all right, Roo dear?
Roo: Look at me swimming!
Eeyore: All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little Roo, and you'll be all right
Christopher Robin: All right, Roo, I'm coming
Rabbit: Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows
Roo: Look at me swimming
Roo: Did you see me swimming? Pooh, did you see me swimming? That's called swimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing? Swimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say, Piglet! What do you think I was doing! Swimming! Christopher Robin, did you see me----
Christopher Robin: Pooh, where did you find that pole?
Pooh: I just found it. I thought it ought to be useful. I just picked it up.
Christopher Robin: Pooh, the Expedition is over. You have found the North Pole!
###
Pooh: I just found it. I thought it ought to be useful. I just picked it up.
Christopher Robin: Pooh, the Expedition is over. You have found the North Pole!
Pooh: Oh!
Eeyore: Tell Roo to be quick, somebody. My tail's getting cold. I don't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to complain but there it is. My tail's cold.
Roo: Here I am!
Eeyore: Oh, there you are.
Roo: Did you see me swimming?
Eeyore: As I expected. Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That's what it's done. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all right.
Christopher Robin: Poor old Eeyore. I'll dry it for you.
Eeyore: Thank you, Christopher Robin. You're the only one who seems to understand about tails. They don't think--that's what the matter with some of these others. They've no imagination. A tail isn't a tail to them, it's just a Little Bit Extra at the back.
Christopher Robin: Never mind, Eeyore. Is that better?
Eeyore: It's feeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know what I mean.
Pooh: Hullo, Eeyore.
Eeyore: Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again in a day or two.
Pooh: Use what?
Eeyore: What we are talking about.
Pooh: I wasn't talking about anything.
Eeyore: My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?
Pooh: No. That wasn't me. Perhaps it was somebody else.
Eeyore: Well, thank him for me when you see him.
Christopher Robin: Pooh's found the North Pole. Isn't that lovely?
###
Christopher Robin: Well, thank him for me when you see him.
Christopher Robin: Pooh's found the North Pole. Isn't that lovely?
Eeyore: Is that it?
Christopher Robin: Yes.
Eeyore: Is that what we were looking for?
Pooh: Yes.
Eeyore: Oh! Well, anyhow--it didn't rain.
Piglet: Did you ever see such rain, Pooh?
Pooh: Isn't it awful, Piglet?
Piglet: I wonder how it is over Christopher Robin's way.
Pooh: I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by this time.
###
Christopher Robin: There's a South Pole, and I expect there's an East Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them.
Pooh: This is Serious. I must have an Escape.
###
Pooh: Bother! All that wet for nothing. What's that bit of paper doing?
Pooh: It's a Missage, that's what it is. And that letter is a 'P,' and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means 'Pooh,' so it's a very important Missage to me, and I can't read it. I must find Christopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can read things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can't swim. Bother!
Pooh: If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if a jar floats, I can sit on the top of it, if it's a very big jar.
Pooh: All boats have to have a name, so I shall call mine _The Floating Bear_.
###
Owl: That's all right. I'll go. Back directly.
Owl: Pooh isn't there.
Christopher Robin: Not there?
Owl: Has _been_ there. He's been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey. But he isn't there now.
Christopher Robin: Oh, Pooh! Where _are_ you?
Pooh: Here I am.
Christopher Robin: Pooh!
Christopher Robin: How did you get here, Pooh?
Pooh: On my boat. I had a Very Important Missage sent me in a bottle, and owing to having got some water in my eyes, I couldn't read it, so I brought it to you. On my boat.
Christopher Robin: But it's from Piglet!
Pooh: Isn't there anything about Pooh in it?
Christopher Robin: Oh, are those 'P's' piglets? I thought they were poohs.
Christopher Robin: We must rescue him at once! I thought he was with _you_, Pooh. Owl, could you rescue him on your back?
Owl: I don't think so. It is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles----
Christopher Robin: Then would you fly to him at _once_ and say that Rescue is Coming? And Pooh and I will think of a Rescue and come as quick as ever we can. Oh, don't _talk_, Owl, go on quick!
Christopher Robin: Now then, Pooh, where's your boat?
Pooh: I ought to say that it isn't just an ordinary sort of boat. Sometimes it's a Boat, and sometimes it's more of an Accident. It all depends.
Christopher Robin: Depends on what?
Pooh: On whether I'm on the top of it or underneath it.
Christopher Robin: Oh! Well, where is it?
Pooh: There!
###
Christopher Robin: Depends on what?
Pooh: On whether I'm on the top of it or underneath it.
Christopher Robin: Oh! Well, where is it?
Pooh: There!
Christopher Robin: But it's too small for two of us.
Pooh: Three of us with Piglet.
Christopher Robin: That makes it smaller still. Oh, Pooh Bear, what shall we do?
Pooh: We might go in your umbrella.
Pooh: We might go in your umbrella.
Pooh: We might go in your umbrella.
Christopher Robin: I shall call this boat _The Brain of Pooh_.
###
Christopher Robin: Owl, I am going to give a party.
Owl: You are, are you?
Christopher Robin: And it's to be a special sort of party, because it's because of what Pooh did when he did what he did to save Piglet from the flood.
Owl: Oh, that's what it's for, is it?
Christopher Robin: Yes, so will you tell Pooh as quickly as you can, and all the others, because it will be to-morrow.
Owl: Oh, it will, will it?
Christopher Robin: So will you go and tell them, Owl?
Owl: Pooh, Christopher Robin is giving a party.
Pooh: Oh! Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar icing?
###
Pooh: A party for Me? How grand!
Owl: Eeyore, Christopher Robin is giving a party.
Eeyore: Very interesting. I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don't mention it.
###
Owl: Eeyore, Christopher Robin is giving a party.
Eeyore: Very interesting. I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don't mention it.
Owl: There is an Invitation for you.
Eeyore: What's that like?
Owl: An Invitation!
Eeyore: Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it?
Owl: This isn't anything to eat, it's asking you to the party. To-morrow.
Eeyore: You mean Piglet. The little fellow with the excited ears. That's Piglet. I'll tell him.
Owl: No, no! It's you!
Eeyore: Are you sure?
Owl: Of course I'm sure. Christopher Robin said 'All of them! Tell all of them.'
Eeyore: All of them, except Eeyore?
Owl: All of them.
Eeyore: Ah! A mistake, no doubt, but still, I shall come. Only don't blame me if it rains.
Roo: Hallo, Pooh!
Pooh: Hallo, Roo!
Roo: Hallo, Piglet!
Roo: Hallo, Eeyore!
Eeyore: It will rain soon, you see if it doesn't.

Roo: H-hup!
Kanga: Roo, dear!
Roo: Was it me?
Piglet: What's Eeyore talking about?
Pooh: I don't know.
Piglet: I thought this was _your_ party.
Pooh: I thought it was _once_. But I suppose it isn't.
Piglet: I'd sooner it was yours than Eeyore's.
Pooh: So would I.
Roo: H-hup!
Eeyore: AS--I--WAS--SAYING, as I was saying when I was interrupted by various Loud Sounds, I feel that----
Christopher Robin: Here it is! Pass it down to silly old Pooh. It's for Pooh.
Eeyore: For Pooh?
Christopher Robin: Of course it is. The best bear in all the world.
Eeyore: I might have known. After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said 'Bother!' The Social Round. Always something going on.
Various characters: Open it, Pooh.
Various characters: What is it, Pooh?
Various characters: I know what it is.
Various characters: No, you don't.

Pooh: Oh!
Everyone except Eeyore: Oh, Pooh!
Pooh: Thank you
Eeyore: This writing business. Pencils and what-not. Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it.
Piglet: When you wake up in the morning, Pooh, what's the first thing you say to yourself?
Pooh: What's for breakfast? What do you say, Piglet?
Piglet: I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting to-day?
Pooh: It's the same thing.
Christopher Robin: And what did happen?
Pooh: When?
Christopher Robin: Next morning.
Pooh: I don't know.
Christopher Robin: Could you think and tell me and Pooh some time?
Pooh: If you wanted it very much.
Christopher Robin: Pooh does.
Christopher Robin: Coming to see me have my bath?
Narrator: I might.
Christopher Robin: Was Pooh's pencil case any better than mine?
Narrator: It was just the same.
